Oxygen not being used despite availability → blood returns to PA with more O2 than expected"	ccrn::multisystem sepsis shock hemodynamics
"Question:
What is sepsis-2 definition vs sepsis-3 definition difference?"	"Answer:
Sepsis-2: systemic response (SIRS+) to infection
Sepsis-3: life-threatening organ dysfunction from abnormal host response to infection
Sepsis-3 eliminated SIRS and \"severe sepsis\" terms"	ccrn::multisystem sepsis
"Question:
What is normal SvO2 range?"	"Answer:
60-75%"	ccrn::multisystem hemodynamics
"Question:
In what shock states is SvO2 low?"	"Answer:
Hypovolemic, anaphylactic, cardiogenic (poor O2 delivery causes low O2 utilization)"	ccrn::multisystem shock hemodynamics
"Question:
In what shock state is SvO2 elevated?"	"Answer:
Septic shock (adequate O2 delivery but poor O2 utilization at cellular level)"	ccrn::multisystem sepsis shock hemodynamics
