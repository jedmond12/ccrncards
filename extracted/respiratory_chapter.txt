Respiratory Concepts


The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack
of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.

    respiratory concepts, the terms respiratory and pulmonary are
synonymous and are used interchangeably throughout this
book.


 Plan on spending approximately 22 hours studying respiratory
 concepts, since there will be 22 questions related to
 respiratory topics. The first half of this chapter reviews
 pulmonary physiological concepts that may appear on the
 exam. These concepts are the basis of the specific
 respiratory disorders and treatments that are covered in the
 second half of this chapter.
Pulmonary Assessment and Physiology
Ventilation
  Ventilation is the movement of air in (from the atmosphere) and out (from the
  body) to maintain appropriate concentrations of O2 and CO2.
  Central control (brain stem): primary control
    Senses blood pH, decrease in pH → ventilation is stimulated
    A decrease in pH = acidosis, which results in an increase in the rate and/or
    depth of breathing
  Peripheral control (PaO2 “sensors” in aortic arch): secondary control
    Senses PaO2 of blood, decrease in PaO2 → ventilation stimulated
    Decrease in PaO2 = hypoxemia, which results in an increase in the rate
    and/or depth of breathing
    Chronic PaCO2 retainers rely on mild hypoxemia for ventilator drive. If the
    PaO2 is corrected to normal, this may result in a decreased drive to breathe
     (ventilate).
  What is the clinical indicator of ventilation? How do you know that your patient
  is ventilating normally?
     You need to know the PaCO2 (NOT the PaO2).
  What is minute ventilation?
   Tidal volume (Vt) × respiratory rate (RR)—easily seen on the ventilator of a
   patient who requires mechanical ventilation
   Normal ventilation is ~ 4 L/minute.
   An increase in minute ventilation = an increase in work of breathing
  What is the primary muscle of ventilation?
   Diaphragm
   Anything that affects the “health” of the diaphragm (deconditioning,
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypophosphatemia) will adversely affect ventilation.
  What is the position for optimal ventilation?
   Upright sitting position
Supine position is NOT good for ventilation; if a patient is in respiratory
distress, the worst position for the patient is flat on his or her back!
Dead Space Ventilation
   Volume of air that does not participate in gas exchange
     Anatomic dead space: ~ 2 mL/kg of Vt
    — We all have this; it is normal.
    — No gas exchange at level of nose down to alveoli
     Alveolar dead space: pathologic, non-perfused alveoli, PE
     Physiological dead space = anatomic dead space + alveolar dead space
✰ A pulmonary embolus results in increased alveolar dead space! A clot in the
  pulmonary circulation (a pulmonary embolus): no blood flow past alveoli in that
  area of the pulmonary circulation (Figure 4-1).




                      Figure 4-1. Dead space ventilation
Pulmonary Perfusion
The main function of the pulmonary system is gas exchange. For gas exchange
to occur normally, there needs to be ventilation. However, movement of air alone
is not enough for normal gas exchange. There needs to be perfusion, movement
of blood past alveoli.

   Pulmonary perfusion is movement of blood through pulmonary capillaries.
   Any decrease in blood flow past alveoli (e.g., pulmonary embolus, low cardiac
   output states) will affect the ventilation/perfusion ratio and gas exchange.
   Normal ventilation/perfusion ratio:




   Ideal lung unit = 0.8 ratio, normal V/Q ratio

Any problem that alters ventilation (V) or perfusion (Q) can result in abnormal gas
exchange if compensatory mechanisms are not successful. For example, even
though it is not a pulmonary problem, a low cardiac output can result in poor gas
exchange.

   You will not be expected to calculate V/Q ratios for the exam. However, you
   will need to know that the pulmonary problems (discussed in this chapter) will
   result in abnormal V/Q ratios, from mild to extreme, depending upon the
   extent of the problem.


EFFECT OF GRAVITY ON PULMONARY PERFUSION
   In the upright position, most pulmonary blood is in the lower lung lobes (see A
   in Figure 4-2). When lying supine, most pulmonary blood is posterior (see B in
   Figure 4-2). Rarely are ALL lung units perfused, but an example would be
   vigorous exercise (as in C in Figure 4-2).
                         Figure 4-2. Perfused lung units


   What are the clinical implications?
✰ You want the “good” lung down.
    Large right lung pneumonia: if the patient is turned to the right (“bad” lung),
    more blood goes to the right, and the patient may become hypoxemic.
    This patient should not be turned to the right side.
✰ Perfusion of under-perfused anterior chest alveoli explains the improved
  oxygenation seen during PRONE positioning for severe hypoxemia.
V/Q Ratio
✰ Normal V/Q ratio
    When there are no problems with either ventilation or perfusion, the patient
    will have normal gas exchange on room air (Figure 4-3).
                     Figure 4-3. Normal V/Q ratio, FiO2
                                    0.21

Abnormal V/Q ratio
     When there is a problem with ventilation or perfusion, there is a V/Q
     mismatch.
     The patient will develop hypoxemia on room air. However, providing oxygen
     will generally correct the hypoxemia until the etiology can be determined
     and addressed (Figure 4-4).




       Figure 4-4. V/Q mismatch (i.e., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism)


    Treatment of V/Q mismatch
   — Give O2
   — Identify and treat the underlying problem
✰ Shunt
    An extreme V/Q mismatch; even providing 100% FiO2 will NOT correct the
    hypoxemia (Figure 4-5).
     Figure 4-5. Shunt (i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS))

   A shunt is movement of blood from the right side of the heart to the left side of
   the heart without getting oxygenated; venous blood moves to the arterial side.
   Normal physiological shunt: Thebesian veins of the heart empty into the left
   atrium. This is why the normal oxygen saturation on room air is 95% to 99%; it
   cannot be 100% on room air due to this shunt. (With supplemental oxygen,
   100% saturation can be achieved.)
   Anatomic shunt: two examples are a ventricular septal defect and an atrial
   septal defect.
✰ Pathologic shunt: ARDS! Blood goes through the lungs but does NOT get
  oxygenated, resulting in refractory hypoxemia.
    Treatment of a shunt: administer oxygen, AND
    Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
   — Prevents expiratory pressure from returning to zero; by keeping expiratory
     pressure POSITIVE, it . . .
   — ↓ Surface tension of the alveoli, preventing atelectasis
   — ↑ Alveolar recruitment
— ↑ Driving pressure, extends time of gas transfer, allows for a ↓ in FiO2
   (Figure 4-6)




                  Figure 4-6. Visual representation of PEEP

— With the addition of PEEP to the airway (provided in cm water pressure,
  i.e., 10 cm, 15 cm), hypoxemia will be addressed and the FiO2 may be
   decreased from 100%.
Assessment of Oxygenation in the Critically Ill
Adequate oxygenation is the delivery of O2 to meet tissue demands at the
cellular level. In order to achieve this, each of the following needs to occur:

   Adequate ventilation
   Transfer of O2 across alveolar-capillary membrane
   Presence of hemoglobin to carry O2
   Adequate cardiac output to deliver O2 to the tissue bed
   Release of O2 from the hemoglobin molecule
   Ability of cells to utilize O2

At the cellular level, sufficient oxygen is needed for the production of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), which is needed for cell energy and life. See Figure 4-7 to
see how oxygen is needed for aerobic metabolism, along with the production of
sufficient ATP for cell life. Without sufficient oxygen at the cellular level, lactic acid
is produced (LACTIC ACIDOSIS), which is the evidence of anaerobic
metabolism, organ failure, and eventual cell death.




             Figure 4-7. Importance of oxygen at the cellular level
It is NOT sufficient to examine only PaO2 and SaO2! For example, a patient
with sepsis/septic shock may have a normal PaO2, SaO2, and hemoglobin; clear
lungs; and adequate ventilation and oxygen delivery, yet a lactate level of 10.
This is lactic acidosis. Why? Oxygen utilization is affected by sepsis/septic shock
and results in anaerobic metabolism at the cellular level. Table 4-1 lists the
clinical indicators of oxygenation in the critically ill.


                      Table 4-1. Indicators of Oxygenation




 ✰ For the exam:
  ➤ Do not memorize the formulas.
   ➤ Remember that the assessment of oxygenation is more than just
      examining the PaO2 or SaO2.
   ➤ Consider the effects of severe anemia, low cardiac output, and an inability
     to utilize oxygen even when delivery is adequate (e.g., sepsis).



Most critically ill patients have continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation (SaO2)
that is noninvasively measured with the use of a bedside pulse oximetry (SpO2).
Although the normal SaO2 on room air is 95% to 99%, the goal for most critically
ill patients is to maintain the SpO2 at 90% or greater, usually with supplemental
oxygen. Note from the curve depicted in Figure 4-8 that when the SaO2 is less
than 90%, the PaO2 is less than 60 mmHg. When the PaO2 is less than 60
mmHg, cells begin to have difficulty maintaining aerobic metabolism (without
compensation, i.e., an increase in heart rate or oxygen delivery).
                      Figure 4-8. PaO2/SaO2 relationship


For the Adult CCRN exam, you will need to understand a high-level concept: the
oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve. Certain clinical conditions make
hemoglobin “hold on” to oxygen molecules (the curve shifts to the LEFT). Other
conditions allow hemoglobin to “release” the oxygen more easily to the tissue (the
curve shifts to the RIGHT). See Table 4-2 for conditions that shift the curve to the
left and right and Figure 4-9 for an illustration of the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation
curve.

  Table 4-2. Clinical Conditions That Cause a Shift of the Oxyhemoglobin-
                              Dissociation Curve
            Figure 4-9. Oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve

Conditions that cause a shift to the left result in a higher SaO2, but the tissues
do not get needed O2 as readily.
Conditions that cause a shift to the right result in a somewhat lower SaO2, but
the tissues receive O2 more readily.
2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG)
  What is 2,3-DPG? It is an organic phosphate, found in RBCs, that has the
  ability to alter the affinity of Hgb for oxygen.
    Decreased 2,3-DPG results in hemoglobin holding on to O2 (Table 4-3).
    Increased 2,3-DPG results in hemoglobin more readily releasing O2 (Table
    4-3).

            Table 4-3. Effect of 2,3-DPG on Hgb Affinity for Oxygen
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
   Carbon monoxide (CO) has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen—
   approximately 230 times greater (Figure 4-10)!




           Figure 4-10. Carbon monoxide’s effects on hemoglobin

   In the presence of CO, oxygen cannot be carried → tissue hypoxia.
   Do NOT use pulse oximetry to monitor the oxygenation status for a patient
   with CO poisoning. The pulse oximeter cannot differentiate between CO and
   O2. Therefore, an SpO2 of 95%, in the presence of CO poisoning, only means
   that the hemoglobin is saturated with a total of 95% molecules.
     If the CO level of the blood is 40%, the maximum amount of O2 that can be
     carried by hemoglobin is 60%.
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels and associated clinical presentation:

   0–5% = Normal
   < 15% = Often in smokers, truck drivers
   15–40% = Headache, some confusion
   40–60% = Loss of consciousness, Cheyne-Stokes respiration
   50–70% = Mortality > 50%
✰ Treatment
   100% FiO2 until symptoms resolve and carboxyhemoglobin level is < 10%
   Hyperbaric oxygen chamber if available, generally within 30 minutes
Lung Compliance
Think of compliance as the degree of elasticity of tissue. Therefore, a decrease in
compliance increases resistance or stiffness.

   Static compliance: measurement of the elastic properties of the lung




    Note that an increase in plateau pressure will decrease compliance.
   Dynamic compliance: measurement of the elastic properties of the airways




     Note that an increase in peak inspiratory pressure will decrease
     compliance.
   Normal for both is ~ 45–50 mL/cm H2O.
   Patients with pulmonary problems that mainly involve the airways (e.g.,
   asthma) have a decrease in dynamic compliance, but their static compliance
   remains normal (Figure 4-11).
   Patients with pulmonary problems that mainly involve the lungs (e.g.,
   pneumonia, ARDS) have a decrease in static compliance, but their dynamic
   compliance may also decrease as the lung pressures may transmit up to the
   airways (Figure 4-11).
               Figure 4-11. Dynamic vs. static compliance


  TIP

  ✰ For the exam, remember that decreased compliance increases the work of
  breathing.



Status asthmaticus
  Static compliance (lungs) would be normal.
  Dynamic compliance would be low.
ARDS
  Static compliance would be low.
  Dynamic compliance would also be low.
Acid-Base Interpretation
ABGs WILL be tested on the Adult CCRN exam. You need to understand the 4
major acid-base abnormalities as well as states of compensation—
uncompensated, partial compensation, and full compensation. Not only will you
need to know how to interpret the ABG, but you will also need to know what the
clinical implications are for the patient and the treatment, if there are any. How did
you do on the ABG question in the pretest of this book? A succinct review of acid-
base interpretation is given in Table 4–4. Practice ABGs are also provided later in
this section (with answers at the end of this chapter) so that you can practice as
needed.

                       Table 4-4. Normal ABG Parameters




The information that follows will focus on acid-base interpretation, not
oxygenation, which is covered in other areas of this book.
General Points Related to Acid-Base Balance
   Remember that the pH represents the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the
   blood.
   Due to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when the H+ concentration is
   increased, the pH decreases, and when the H+ concentration is decreased,
   the pH increases. There is an inverse relationship between the H+ and the pH,
   so don’t get confused!
   Think of PaCO2 as an acid. When it increases, there is acidosis. When it
   decreases, there is alkalosis.
     The PaCO2 is controlled by the lungs. It is the respiratory parameter.
     The lungs can change the PaCO2 within minutes (rapid change).
   Think of HCO3 as a base. When it is greater than normal, alkalosis may be
   present. When it is less than normal, acidosis may be present.
     The HCO3 is controlled by the kidneys. It is the metabolic parameter.
     The kidneys alter the HCO3 over hours to days (slow change).

 Table 4-5. Four Primary Acid-Base Disorders and Expected Compensatory
                                 Change




Anion Gap
The anion gap is the difference between positive and negative anions. In most
instances of metabolic acidosis, there is an increase in the anion gap. In several
types of metabolic acidosis, though, the anion gap remains normal.
You will NOT need to calculate the anion gap for this exam, but you should know
what is normal:




   Normal is 5–15 mEq/L.
   The anion gap is helpful in determining the cause of and/or response to
   treatment for metabolic acidosis (Table 4-6). For instance, if a patient with
   DKA presents with an anion gap of 25 mEq/L, one would expect the anion gap
   to decrease gradually as the patient responds positively to treatment. Since
   electrolytes are assessed frequently, the acidosis can be monitored by
   monitoring the anion gap without getting frequent ABGs.

               Table 4-6. Problems Associated with the Anion Gap




      NOTE

      You will not need to know how to calculate the anion gap for this exam.




Acid-Base Compensation
   Compensation is the body’s way of attempting to return the pH to normal
   (7.35–7.45).
     Uncompensated
     Partial compensation
     Full compensation: rare in critically ill, suspect a mixed disorder if present
     Review Tables 4-7, 4-8, 4-9, and 4-10

COMBINED ACID-BASE DISORDERS—SELDOM SEEN ON
THE EXAM
Occurs when 2 single disorders are present simultaneously to produce the same
abnormality.

   Combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis:
    pH         7.21

    PaCO2      50
   HCO3       12

 Combined respiratory and metabolic alkalosis:

   pH         7.59

   PaCO2      30

   HCO3       33


MIXED ACID-BASE DISORDERS—SELDOM SEEN ON THE
EXAM
 Simple acid-base disorders result from a single process, such as metabolic
 acidosis.
 In many critically ill patients, multiple acid-base disturbances exist concurrently
 and result in complex, mixed acid-base disorders.
 For example, a patient with septic shock may present with respiratory alkalosis
 and metabolic acidosis.
 Complex formulas can be applied to determine whether the compensating
 parameter (PaCO2 or HCO3) has compensated more than predicted for the
 primary problem, indicating that a mixed disorder is present. You will not need
 to know these formulas for this exam.


SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT OF ACID-BASE
1. Evaluate the pH → determine whether it is normal, acidotic, or alkalotic.
2. Evaluate respiratory parameters and then renal parameters → determine
   which, if either, is abnormal.
3. Determine the state of compensation.
4. Evaluate for a mixed disorder.
5. Assess oxygenation (PaO2, SaO2).
Practice ABGs
 Directions: Interpret each of the following ABGs. Identify the primary problem and the type
 of compensation. The answers can be found on page 108.

Respiratory Disorders
About 14 respiratory topics are included in the Adult CCRN test
blueprint. However, some topics are more likely to be included on the
exam than others. It is highly recommended that you study ARDS,
status asthmaticus, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism in order to
do well on the respiratory questions. The physiological concepts that
were reviewed previously in this chapter are the foundation for all of
the respiratory disorders. Specific respiratory disorders that are likely
to be seen on this exam are reviewed in the following sections.
Acute Respiratory Failure
 Acute respiratory failure is defined as a rapidly occurring inability
 of the lungs to maintain adequate oxygenation of the blood with
 or without impairment of carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination.
 Specifically, the ABG demonstrates:
   PaO2 of 60 mmHg or less, with or without an elevation of
   PaCO2 to 50 mmHg or more with pH < 7.30
 As seen from the definition, the primary problem may be one of
 hypoxemia (Type 1) or hypercarbia (Type 2) or both (Type 3).
 Type 1 (Hypoxemic)
   ARDS
   Asthma
   Atelectasis
   Interstitial fibrosis
   Pneumonia
   Pulmonary edema (heart failure)
   Pulmonary embolism (massive)
   Smoke inhalation
 Type 2 (Hypercapnic)
   CNS depression due to oversedation
   COPD (acute exacerbation)
   Head trauma
   Musculoskeletal disorders or trauma
   Sleep apnea
   Status asthmaticus
 Type 3
     ARDS (late)
     COPD (late, acute exacerbation)
     Status asthmaticus (late)
   Clinical signs/symptoms of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
     Pulmonary: tachypnea, adventitious breath sounds, accessory
     muscle use
     Cardiac: tachyarrhythmias (initial), bradyarrhythmias (late),
     hypertension or hypotension, cyanosis (central, e.g., lips,
     earlobes)
     Neurological: anxiety, agitation
   Clinical signs/symptoms of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure
     Pulmonary: shallow breathing, bradypnea, lungs may be clear
     or there may be adventitious breath sounds
     Neurological: progressive decreased level of consciousness
     (lethargic, obtunded, stuporous, unresponsive)
Prompt identification and treatment may prevent a catastrophic
outcome! The etiology of the signs/symptoms may not be the
primary focus initially.
Treatment of Acute Respiratory Failure
  Maintain airway and improve ventilation.
   Positioning (upright)
   Suctioning
   Bronchodilator therapy for wheezing
   Noninvasive ventilation
   Intubation, mechanical ventilation if needed
   Repeat ABGs as needed
  Optimize oxygenation.
   Adjust FiO2 to keep SaO2 ~ > 0.90
    Decrease FiO2 to 0.50 or less ASAP
    Do not allow hypoxemia to occur to “prevent O2 toxicity”
    Use PEEP/CPAP as needed
    Use pulse oximetry to monitor response to therapy
  Optimize circulation, cardiac output.
    Manage hypotension
    Address cardiac arrhythmias
  Identify the etiology, target treatment accordingly.
  Provide emotional support.
Use of Noninvasive Ventilation for the
Management of Acute Respiratory Failure
When used for an appropriate patient, noninvasive ventilation (NIV)
has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. There are 2
main types of NIV. Generally, though, the exam does not cover the
details related to the type of NIV. More importantly, understand those
who would NOT benefit from this therapy. Occasionally, a patient
may initially be a good candidate for NIV but then, due to a change
in condition, the patient should be intubated with an endotracheal
tube.

   CPAP—Continuous positive airway pressure
    Indicated for patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure who
    have increased work of breathing (e.g., cardiogenic pulmonary
    edema)
    Settings include FiO2 and 1 pressure setting in cm H2O
     pressure.
   BiPAP—Bilevel positive airway pressure
     Indicated for patients with hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic
     respiratory failure
     Settings include FiO2 and 2 pressure settings: the inspiratory
     positive airway pressure (IPAP) and the expiratory positive
     airway pressure (EPAP).
     IPAP assists ventilation and EPAP assists oxygenation.


Advantages of NIV
   Buys time for medical treatment to take effect
   Reduces the work of breathing (WOB)
   Decreases preload and afterload
   Improves oxygenation
   Improves ventilation (BiPAP)
   Reduces atelectasis
   Prevents intubation and resultant risks
✰ Contraindications for NIV
    Hemodynamic instability or life-threatening arrhythmias
    Copious secretions
    High risk of aspiration
    Impaired mental status (unable to protect airway)
    Suspected pneumothorax
    Inability to cooperate
    Life-threatening refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 with FiO2
    1.00)
Use of High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) Oxygen
HFNC oxygen therapy, which has long been used for pediatric and
infant populations, is now used for select adult populations in the
treatment of acute respiratory failure and post-extubation.

   HFNC oxygen delivery systems are able to deliver FiO2 (up to
   100%) of heated and humidified gas at flow rates up to 60
   L/minute via a nasal cannula.
   Advantages of HFNC therapy
     Able to provide high FiO2 (up to 100%)
     Heated and humidified oxygen may improve secretion
     clearance and decrease airway inflammation
     Able to meet high inspiratory flow demands of tachypneic
     patients
     Seems to promote alveolar recruitment and increase FRC
     Decreases dead space ventilation
     More comfortable than CPAP or BiPAP masks, allows access
     to the mouth without removal of a mask
   Limitations of HFNC oxygen therapy
     Unable to deliver higher airway pressures (PEEP or CPAP),
     and the low levels of airway pressure provided are variable
     when mouth breathing
     Provides limited pressure support for a patient with
     hypercapnic respiratory failure
   Indications: community-acquired pneumonia; cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema when NIV is not tolerated; preoxygenation
prior to intubation; post-extubation (even in low-risk patients); for
a patient who refuses intubation (DNI) but accepts alternate
treatment measures
HFNC oxygen therapy may also be used in conjunction with NIV
post-extubation to prevent re-intubation.
Nursing implications
   Monitor for deteriorating oxygenation/ventilation (the patient
   may require NIV or intubation and mechanical ventilation)
   Assess for nasal skin irritation
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD): Acute Exacerbation
 COPD includes emphysema, asthma, and bronchitis (more
 details on status asthmaticus are in the next section).
 In general, with each type of COPD, it is easier for air to enter the
 pulmonary system than to exit it; inspiration is easier than
 exhalation.
 Physiological consequences of COPD include:
   Dynamic hyperinflation occurs due to too much air in the lungs.
   Air trapping and auto-PEEP are common.
   Expiratory flow rates are LOW.
   An acute exacerbation results in a V/Q mismatch due to a
   problem with ventilation and an increase in the PaCO2.
   The patient may have chronic CO2 retention; if so, the patient
   will have partial or complete compensation and high HCO3 on
   the ABG.
   COPD may result in right ventricular enlargement (cor
   pulmonale) and elevated CVP.
 Signs of an acute exacerbation of COPD include:
  Worsening dyspnea
  Increase in sputum purulence
  Increase in sputum volume
  Hypercapnia, hypoxemia
 Management of an acute exacerbation of COPD includes:
 Titrate FiO2 to PaO2 > 60 mmHg or SaO2 > 90% with care not
 to overcorrect hypoxemia and decrease respiratory drive
— Must address severe hypoxemia; do not withhold oxygen
     only because hypoventilation may occur . . . cells still need
     oxygen
 Bronchodilator therapy
— Inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), e.g., albuterol
— Inhaled anticholinergic
 Monitor the level of consciousness for decreased
 responsiveness (clinical sign of worsening hypercapnia).
 Corticosteroid therapy
 Antibiotic therapy (when pneumonia is thought to be the
 trigger)
 Proceed with mechanical ventilatory support if needed
 (noninvasive or invasive).
— Multiple studies have shown that noninvasive ventilation
    (NIV) is beneficial for patients with an acute exacerbation of
    COPD.
Status Asthmaticus
 Status asthmaticus is airway hyper-reactivity that produces severe airway
 narrowing that is refractory to aggressive bronchodilator therapy, which may
 result in respiratory failure. Status asthmaticus can be fatal as evidenced by the
 pathophysiology diagram in Figure 4-12.
Figure 4-12. Pathophysiology of status
             asthmaticus
Clinical Presentation of Status Asthmaticus
  Dyspnea, tachypnea
  Cough, chest tightness
  Accessory muscle use
  Wheezing → decreased breath sounds → absent breath sounds . . . ominous
  sign!
  V/Q mismatch
  Chest X-ray may have flattened diaphragm (sign of air trapping).
  Tachycardia
  Pulsus paradoxus ≥ 15 mmHg (severe is > 18 mmHg)
  Anxiety → ↓ LOC
  May have elevated WBC, eosinophils
  Peak flow rate < 80% of predicted, < 50% is severe
  History of previous intubations (higher mortality)
  Table 4-11 describes ABG changes.

       Table 4-11. ABG Progression in Status Asthmaticus (on Room Air)
Management of Status Asthmaticus
  Measure presenting peak flow rate (PFR).
   Admit the patient to the hospital if the PFR is 50–70%.
    Admit the patient to the ICU if the PFR is < 50%.
  Bronchodilator: short-acting beta-2 agonists, e.g., albuterol (Ventolin)
  Anticholinergics, e.g., ipratropium (Atrovent)
  Corticosteroids (systemic)
  O2, pulse oximetry
  Hydration to prevent thickened secretions
  Avoid sedation agents.
  Intubation, mechanical ventilation if any of the following ominous signs occur:
    Respiratory acidosis
    Severe hypoxemia
      Silent chest
      Change in the level of consciousness (LOC)
  If the patient is intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation, avoid paralytics
  because paralytics combined with steroids increase incidences of neuropathy.
 ✰ Ventilator management for status asthmaticus
   Use low rate to increase exhalation time.
   Use low tidal volumes to prevent auto-PEEP.
   Increase inspiration/expiration (I/E) ratio, often greater than 1:3–4, to allow time
   for optimal exhalation and to prevent auto-PEEP.
Pulmonary Embolism
 A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a partial or complete obstruction of the pulmonary
 capillary bed by a blood clot or another substance such as fat, air, amniotic fluid,
 or a foreign material, with a disruption of blood flow to an area of the lung.
   Massive: > 50% occlusion
   Submassive: < 50% occlusion
   80–90% result from DVT
 Although a pulmonary embolism may be the result of a variety of causes, venous
 thromboembolism (VTE) is the primary cause. VTE and a fat embolism are the 2
 types of embolism that are most likely to be covered on the Adult CCRN exam.
 Refer to Table 4-12 for the risk factors for VTE and Figure 4-13 for the
 pathophysiology of PE.

         Table 4-12. Risk Factors for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)
                   Figure 4-13. Pathophysiology of pulmonary
                                   embolism


Refer to Table 4-13 for the signs and symptoms of a PE.

                    Table 4-13. Signs and Symptoms of a PE
Types of PE
  Venous thromboembolism—DVT
  Fat emboli—long bone, pelvic fractures
  Air emboli—surgery, IV lines
  Catheter embolization
  RA/LA or RV embolus—AFib/flutter (left atrial leading to stroke is more common)
  Amniotic fluid embolism (rare)—amniocentesis, abruptio placenta, or abortion
  Tumor emboli—malignancy causes an increase in thrombin
  Septic emboli—bacterial/viral
Diagnosis of PE
   Pulmonary angiography—gold standard!
   V/Q scan: “high” probability, “low” probability, not definitive
   High-speed CT scan
   D-dimer: good rule-out test; if positive, it means that a clot is present in the body;
   therefore, if symptoms ARE due to a PE, expect the D-dimer to be positive
   Venous Doppler (helps with source)

  TIP

  ✰ A PE will increase alveolar dead space!



Note: ~ 2/3 of PEs never get diagnosed!


Table 4-14 lists mechanical and pharmacological agents that are used to prevent
PEs.


                            Table 4-14. Prevention of PEs
Treatment of PE
  Maintain adequate airway, ventilation, and oxygenation
  Fluids!
  Anticoagulation
    Heparin (80 units/kg IVP and then 18 units/kg/hr drip)
    Low–molecular-weight heparin (1 mg/kg q 12 hrs)
    Coumadin on the first treatment day if able
    The patient may require long-term anticoagulation.


    NOTE

    You will not need to know drug doses for this exam.



  Fibrinolytic therapy: for all patients with hemodynamic compromise with a
  low risk for bleeding
  Maintain cardiac output (inotropes, fluids)
  Analgesics for a patient who experiences pain
Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is included on the test blueprint.
However, you are more likely to see questions that cover status
asthmaticus, PE, pneumonia, and ARDS than questions that cover
PH. Keep this in mind when studying.

   PH is defined as a MEAN pulmonary artery pressure that is
   greater than 25 mmHg at rest and a PAOP that is less than 16
   mmHg at rest with secondary right heart failure.
     The normal mean pulmonary artery pressure is ~ 20 mmHg.
     Since the RV normally pumps into a low-pressure system, the
     wall of the RV is thin compared to that of the LV. Pulmonary
     hypertension results in cor pulmonale and right ventricular
     failure.
   5 groups of PH, as defined by the World Health Organization
   (WHO)
     Group 1—Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); sporadic and
     hereditary due to localized small pulmonary muscular arterioles
     (i.e., collagen vascular diseases, drug/toxin induced)
     Group 2—Pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to left heart
     disease, such as LVF or valvular (mitral, aortic) disease
     Group 3—PH due to lung diseases or hypoxemia
     Group 4—PH due to chronic thromboembolic problems
     Group 5—PH that has unclear factors or is multifactorial (e.g.,
     sarcoidosis)
Signs and Symptoms of Pulmonary Hypertension
  Exertional dyspnea, lethargy, and fatigue due to an inability to
  increase cardiac output with activity
  Progression to RV failure, chest pain, syncope with exertion, and
  peripheral edema
  Passive hepatic congestion may cause anorexia and ABD pain
  Ortner’s syndrome—cough, hemoptysis, and hoarseness
  Systolic ejection murmur, increased intensity of pulmonic
  component of S2 heart sound, diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
  murmur, right-sided murmurs, and gallops are augmented with
  inspiration.
  RV hypertrophy, elevated JVD, hepatomegaly, ascites, and
  pleural effusion
Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension
  Treat the underlying cause as able.
  Each “group” has specific treatments based on the cause.
  All regimens should consider diuretics, oxygen, anticoagulants,
  digoxin, and exercise training.
  Use dilators, which include calcium channel blockers or
  phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, e.g., sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil
  (Cialis), or treprostinil (Remodulin).
  For patients who are refractory to all medical interventions—lung
  transplantation (bilateral or heart-lung transplant) or possible
  atrial septostomy (right-to-left shunt)
Pneumonia
Pneumonia is an acute inflammation of the lung parenchyma
(caused by an infectious agent) that can lead to alveolar
consolidation.

Causative agents include:

 1. Bacterial
 2. Viral
 3. Fungal
 4. Parasitic

Pneumonia may also be classified according to where it developed:

   Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
    Outside the hospital
    Common pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella
    pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
    Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
     Acute care
     Long-term care
     Nursing home
✰ Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP); now referred to as
  ventilator-associated event (VAE)
By definition, develops 48 hours or more after admission to the
hospital
Common pathogens: P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, K.
pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus
(especially diabetes and head trauma), MRSA
HAP has higher mortality than CAP.
Risk Factors for Pneumonia
Multiple factors will increase the risk, including:

   Age
   Preexisting pulmonary disease
   Smoking
   ↓ level of consciousness (LOC)
   Artificial airways
   Chronic illness
   Malnutrition
   Immunocompromised
   Increased secretions
   Atelectasis
   Immobility
   Depressed cough or gag reflexes
   Concurrent antibiotic therapy
   Aspiration
   Organisms spread from another site (gut, wound) to the lungs.
   Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
Signs and Symptoms of Pneumonia
  Chills, diaphoresis, fever, malaise
  Tachycardia, chest pain
  Confusion (especially for the elderly)
  Productive cough
  Use of accessory muscles
  Dehydration
  Over area of consolidation on the chest:
    ↑ Tactile fremitus
    Dull to percussion
    Bronchial breath sounds or diminished breath sounds
    Bronchophony (louder/clearer)
    Egophony (“e” to “a”)
    Whispered pectoriloquy (whisper heard better with a
    stethoscope)
Diagnosis of Pneumonia
  CXR: consolidation or diffuse patchy infiltrates
  Sputum culture with Gram stain
  Blood cultures
  WBC: high but may be normal or low in immunocompromised or
  elderly people
  WBC differential: increased bands > 10%
  ABGs: hypoxemia
  Thoracentesis for effusions
Treatment of Pneumonia
   Optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
    Titrate FiO2
✰ Positioning—GOOD lung DOWN
    Bronchial hygiene, chest physiotherapy
    Prone positioning for severe hypoxemia
    Noninvasive ventilation or intubation/mechanical ventilation as
    needed
    Bronchoscopy (with lavage, if needed)
    Mobilize, clear secretions
   Identify organism
     Sputum culture and sensitivity (C&S)
     Blood cultures
   Antibiotic therapy
     Empiric therapy: choice of agent is based on the likely
     causative organism (as determined by a patient assessment
     and the types of pneumonia seen in the community and in the
     institution) and whether that organism may be resistant to
     therapy
     Timing: first dose within 4 hours if the patient first presents to
     the Emergency Department (and is later admitted to the
     hospital); the first antibiotic dose should be given in the
     Emergency Department; note that if the patient has sepsis, the
     antibiotic timing differs (see Chapter 5 of this book)
     Organism-specific therapy: as soon as the results of the C&S
     are available
System support
  Hydration
  Fever management
  Glucose control
  Nutrition
General preventative measures
  Smoking cessation
  Pneumonia vaccine for those who are 65 and older
  Flu vaccine
Prevention of Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia
  Practice hand hygiene.
  Keep HOB elevated 30 degrees or greater.
  Prevent bacterial translocation from GI tract: use the gut, feed
  patient.
  Practice oral hygiene!
  Provide education on common institution pathogens and the
  rates of nosocomial pneumonia.
  Use evidence-based confirmation of feeding tube placement.
    Confirm with an X-ray prior to using for feeding.
    Mark the exit site with an indelible marker for future reference.
    Assess patency every 4 hours.
    Observe for a change in the length of the external portion of
    the feeding tube (as determined by movement of the marked
    portion of the tube).
    Review routine chest and abdominal X-ray reports to look for
    notations about tube location.
    Observe changes in volume of aspirate from feeding tube.
    If pH strips are available, measure the pH of feeding tube
    aspirates if feedings are interrupted for more than a few hours.
    Observe the appearance of feeding tube aspirates if feedings
    are interrupted for more than a few hours.
    Obtain an X-ray to confirm tube position if there is doubt about
    the tube’s location.
Prevention of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia
Prevention involves all of the interventions for preventing hospital-
acquired pneumonia, plus:

   Drain accumulated condensate from tubing.
   Prevent backflow of tubing condensate into endotracheal tube
   (ETT).
   Change ventilator tubing only when it is contaminated.
   Mobilize the patient.
   Utilize aseptic technique for ETT, tracheostomy suctioning.
   Adhere to mouth care protocol, chlorhexidine mouth rinse.
   Brush teeth to remove plaque.
   Keep ETT cuff inflated.
   Perform subglottic suctioning prior to cuff deflation.
   Perform routine oropharyngeal suctioning.
Aspiration
Aspiration is the inhalation of toxic substances into the lung, with an
injury to the lung that is the result of the chemical, mechanical, and/or
bacterial characteristics of the aspirate.

   Oropharyngeal is most common!
   May or may not involve an infection
   May be acute or chronic: micro or massive
   Table 4-15 shows management techniques.

             Table 4-15. Emergent Management of Aspiration




✰ Due to the anatomy of the right mainstem bronchus (shorter, wider,
  and with less of an angle), most aspirations occur in the RIGHT lung.
  Although aspirations may occur in both lungs, they seldom are
  isolated solely to the left lung.
Etiology of Aspirations
  Altered level of consciousness
  Drug or alcohol abuse
  Depressed gag, cough, or swallowing reflexes
  Presence of feeding tubes (all types)
  Improper patient positioning
  Presence of artificial airways
  Ileus or gastric distension
  History of dysphagia, GERD, esophageal strictures, ↓ GI motility
  Increased secretions
Signs and Symptoms of Aspirations
  Acute respiratory distress
  Presence of gastric contents in oropharynx
  Tachycardia
  Hypoxemia
  Crackles
  Copious secretions due to alveolar edema
  Hypotension (massive fluid shifts may occur)
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS) and Acute Lung Injury (ALI)
ARDS and ALI are syndromes caused by a variety of acute conditions that trigger
an inflammatory response, resulting in an increase in the permeability of the
pulmonary capillary membrane, which allows a transudation of proteinaceous
fluid into the interstitial and alveolar spaces. They may also be referred to as
“noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.” Damage to Type II alveolar cells is one of
the pathological consequences. Since these are the cells that are responsible for
the production of surfactant, massive atelectasis occurs.


  TIP

  ✰ This exam always includes several questions on this topic! Study accordingly.



ALI is similar to ARDS in that both involve a shunt, which results in hypoxemia.
The degree of the shunt is represented by the PaO2 to FiO2 ratio, as described in
Table 4-16. Note that you will not be expected to differentiate between ALI and
ARDS on this exam.

   All of the criteria in Table 4-16 must be present for a diagnosis of ARDS or
   ALI. The pulmonary edema is not due to heart failure. Hypoxemia is
   REFRACTORY, meaning that the FiO2 is increased to the maximum of 100%
   and hypoxemia is still present.
   Since a shunt is present, PEEP needs to be provided in order to increase
   alveolar recruitment and treat the refractory hypoxemia.

                  Table 4-16. Differentiation of ARDS and ALI
NOTE

PEEP treats a shunt by preventing alveolar collapse; it does not necessarily
decrease pulmonary shunting.
PaO2/FiO2 Examples
   The patient is receiving 50% FiO2 and PaO2 is 90:




   The patient is receiving 30% FiO2 and PaO2 is 110:




   The patient is receiving room air and PaO2 is 62:




   The patient is on 100% FiO2 and PaO2 is 95:




Remember: It is not only the PaO2/FiO2 ratio that is considered when diagnosing
ALI or ARDS; the other 3 factors also need to be present.
Surfactant
   Phospholipid/lipoprotein produced by Type II alveolar cells
   Stabilizes alveoli, “keeps them open”
   Increases lung compliance
   Eases work of breathing
   Therefore, with ARDS (destruction of Type II alveolar cells):
     Massive atelectasis, alveolar collapse
     Decreased compliance
     Increased work of breathing
     Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC)

Figure 4-14 and Tables 4-17 and 4-18 show the pathophysiology, etiology, and
signs and symptoms of ARDS and ALI.




                 Figure 4-14. Pathophysiology of ARDS/ALI

Table 4-18. Signs and Symptoms of ARDS/ALI
Treatment of ARDS/ALI
 ✰ Pulmonary stabilization strategies
   Intubation with mechanical ventilation
   PEEP, usually 15 cm H2O or greater; monitor for barotrauma and ↓ cardiac
   output; treat hypotension, but do NOT discontinue PEEP
  — Note: Disconnection of the ventilator circuit (and PEEP) will result in
     alveolar derecruitment and hypoxemia that may not be readily corrected.
   Limit plateau pressure to 30 cm H2O or less.
   Limit tidal volume (Vt) to 5–6 mL/kg → “permissive hypercapnia” to prevent
   volutrauma.
  — A low Vt will cause a rise in the PaCO2 and a drop in the pH; however,
      patients tend to tolerate a pH as low as 7.2.

  Cardiovascular stabilization
   Support the BP (fluids, vasopressors, especially when ARDS is due to
    septic shock).
    Monitor for and treat arrhythmias.
  Prone positioning: helps deliver blood flow to underperfused lung units,
  thereby improving ventilation/perfusion; keeps alveolar lung units open, thus
  improving gas exchange and preventing further injury
    Use extreme caution to avoid misplacement or loss of airway.
    Prevent a pressure injury.
  Monitor acid-base balance.
  DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis
  Analgesia, sedation
  Nutritional support
  Nitric oxide, prone positioning may provide improvement in oxygenation.
  Coordinate the interdisciplinary team—PT, OT, and dietitian.
  Prevent, identify organ failure.
  Provide emotional support (to the patient and the patient’s family).
  Monitor for complications.
No steroids (except for select patients with COVID-19 pneumonia)
Complications of ARDS/ALI
The mortality from ARDS is still around 30%, although patients do not die from
hypoxemia. Instead, they die from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
and other complications, as listed below:

   Secondary infections
   Pulmonary embolus
   Ileus
   Skin breakdown
   Malnutrition
   Barotrauma: pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema
Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax (Figures 4-15 and 4-16 and Table 4-19) is included in the Adult
CCRN test blueprint. A simple, unilateral pneumothorax is generally not life-
threatening, unless it occurs in a patient with end-stage chronic lung disease. A
tension pneumothorax, however, may be life-threatening. Therefore, you must
know the difference between the two types. The test makers also expect you to
have an understanding of chest tube management.




                      Figure 4-15. Pathophysiology of a
                                pneumothorax
Types of Pneumothorax
  Spontaneous
  Traumatic

Hemothorax
 Usually due to trauma; presents as lung collapse, with blood in the pleural
 space or in the mediastinal space
Dullness to percussion
Absent breath sounds on the affected side
Tracheal deviation toward the unaffected side
Treatment for a Pneumothorax
  Pneumothorax > 20%
   Chest tube: reestablish negative pleural pressure
   Supplemental O2
   Treat pain, if needed.
  Pneumothorax < 20%
    O2
   Monitor for lung reexpansion.
   If there is a pneumothorax plus an underlying lung disease, the patient may
   need a chest tube.
✰ Chest Tube Assessment and Management
  Close assessment of the patient’s respiratory status, which should improve
  after chest tube insertion
  Pain assessment, treatment
  Entry site—dressing assessment
  Tubing—no dependent loops!
  Drainage collection chamber
    Keep lower than chest
  Water seal chamber
    Tidaling with deep inspiration is normal.
   Air leak
  — Bubbling in water seal chamber is not normal.
  — May be present postoperatively; if there has not been a leak and now
      there is bubbling, notify the physician.
  — Avoid high airway pressures with chest tubes in place in order to avoid an
       air leak.
  Suction control chamber: gauge or water level determines the amount of
  suction, NOT the wall suction source.
  Clamp only when changing the system, with inadvertent disconnection, or with
  a physician order.
    Clamping cuts off the negative pressure water seal chamber; expanded
    lung may re-collapse.
Mechanical Ventilation
Endotracheal Tube Placement
  Confirmation of correct placement is done immediately after
  intubation.
     Waveform capnography is most accurate.
     End-tidal CO2 detector
   Auscultation
  Cuff inflation to 20 cm H2O pressure
  Obtain a chest radiograph for placement confirmation; should be
  3–5 cm above the carina.
  Assess and document tube placement at the level of the teeth or
  gum line for an ongoing assessment of correct placement.
  If the tube migrates down, it most often migrates to the right lung
  due to the anatomy of the mainstem bronchi (right is shorter/wider,
  with less of an angle, than the left).
  Get ABGs within 20 to 30 minutes of intubation to assess acid-
  base status.
  The endotracheal tube:
      Is narrow and increases airway resistance, similar to breathing
    through a straw
    Is longer than a tracheostomy tube; therefore, it has a greater
    degree of dead space ventilation than a tracheostomy tube
Ventilator Management
  Ventilator breaths may be delivered at a set volume (most
  common for adults) or at a set pressure.
  The main focus of the exam is how the ventilator settings may
  differ depending upon the patient’s primary problem (e.g., ARDS
  or asthma); nontraditional modes of ventilation are not covered on
  this exam.


Ventilator Modes
  Assist-control (AC) mode
    The patient receives the set tidal volume at the set breath rate;
    the patient also receives the set tidal volume for each breath
    triggered by the patient’s spontaneous effort made above the
    set breath rate.
   — For example, if the AC is set at a rate of 12 breaths/minute,
        at a tidal volume of 700 mL, and the patient’s total rate per
      minute is 20, the tidal volume of the 8 extra breaths initiated
      by the patient is 700 mL because the extra breaths are
      sensed by the machine and the set tidal volume (700 mL) is
       given.
    All breaths are machine breaths.
    Provides full ventilatory support
    Not used as a weaning mode unless it is being alternated with
    periods of spontaneous breathing (reducing the AC rate does
    nothing if the patient is spontaneously breathing)
     Can result in overventilation and/or hyperinflation of the lungs at
     higher spontaneous breathing rates
   Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode
     The patient receives the set tidal volume at the set breath rate,
     and all breaths above the set rate are spontaneous breaths at
     the patient’s own tidal volume.
   — For example, if the SIMV is set at a rate of 12 breaths/min, at
     a tidal volume of 700 mL, and the patient’s total rate per
     minute is 20, the tidal volume of the 8 extra breaths will vary
        from breath to breath because the breaths that are
        spontaneously initiated by the patient are at the patient’s own
        tidal volume.
     All machine breaths are synchronized with the patient’s
     breathing effort.
     Provides full or partial ventilatory support
     Reducing the SIMV rate will allow the patient to assume more of
     the work of breathing.
     Spontaneous breaths may be pressure supported.


Ventilator Settings
Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
   Positive pressure is applied to the airways at the end of
   exhalation.
   Increases lung volume at the end of exhalation (FRC), creating
   more surface area for gas exchange; increases alveolar
   recruitment
   Can be applied to patients via artificial airways, full face mask,
   nasal mask, and nasal prongs (neonates)
   Think oxygenation!


Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
   CPAP is PEEP applied to a spontaneously breathing patient.
   The patient does not receive machine breaths.
   The patient assumes all of the work of breathing.
   Usually the last step in the weaning process
   All breaths may be pressure supported.
   The patient may experience fatigue if left on CPAP for an
   extended period of time.

Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
   The patient receives an increase in airway pressure during
   inspiration to augment (boost) the spontaneous tidal volume.
   Patient-triggered mode (if the patient is paralyzed and/or sedated,
   PSV will not be triggered on)
   Rate, tidal volume, inspiratory flow rate, and inspiratory time are
   determined by the patient’s effort.
   You cannot use PSV with assist-control mode.
   PSV is frequently used during weaning to reduce the work of
   breathing and to overcome imposed work of ETT and ventilator
   circuit.


Breath Rate
   The breath rate is determined by the PaCO2, generally 12–16
   breaths/minute on full ventilator support.

Tidal Volume (Vt)
   The tidal volume (Vt) is determined by the patient’s ideal body
   weight and medical problem.
   Generally, the Vt is 6–8 mL/kg.
   For ARDS, in order to prevent “volutrauma,” it is 5–6 mL/kg.

Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2)
   The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is generally set at 100% on
   intubation and is then adjusted down according to the PaO2; the
   goal is to decrease it to 50% or less as soon as you are able to.


Ventilator Alarms
   Alarms are set for patient safety.

Cause of High-Pressure Limit Alarms
   Agitation
   Coughing
   Secretions
   Aspiration
   Kinked/occluded ETT or ventilator circuit
   Bronchospasm or mucosal edema
   Decreasing lung compliance (ARDS)
   Pneumothorax

Cause of Low-Pressure Limit Alarms
   Ventilator circuit disconnection or leak
   Inadequate tidal volume
   Cuff leak
   Chest tube leak
If You Are Unable to Troubleshoot an Alarm, What Should You Do?
   Disconnect the ventilator from the airway, and ventilate with a
   bag/valve device.
   A bag/valve device should be at the bedside of every patient who
   is receiving mechanical ventilation, with the mask available as
   well, in case there is an issue with the artificial airway.
   As noted in the section on ARDS, disconnecting the ventilator
   circuit (and PEEP) for a patient who requires high PEEP will result
   in alveolar derecruitment and hypoxemia, which may not be
   readily corrected.
✰ Refer to Table 4-20 for the different ventilator setting guidelines
  used for ARDS and asthma.

Answers and Explanations
 1. (C) Noninvasive ventilation is not safe for a patient who is
    unable to protect his or her airway. A depressed level of
    consciousness increases the risk of airway obstruction or
    aspiration. Choice (A) can be provided with NIV. Choices (B)
    and (D) do not put a patient who is receiving NIV at a greater
    risk for a poor outcome.
 2. (A) This scenario describes a patient who is experiencing a
    pulmonary embolism (PE). Signs of hypotension and
    hypoxemia indicate that it is a massive PE. The PE increases
    dead space ventilation due to the drop in pulmonary perfusion.
    Fibrinolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator) is indicated
    for a massive PE. For any of the other choices to be correct, the
    patient would have to have abnormal breath sounds.
 3. (D) This clinical picture is one of asthma. Asthma is an airway
    problem that results in bronchospasm, which increases airway
    pressure as evidenced by an elevated inspiratory pressure
    while the lung pressure itself (the plateau pressure) remains
    normal. Symptoms would be relieved with a bronchodilator. The
    other choices would not relieve these symptoms.
 4. (C) A patient with asthma has difficulty with expiration.
    Therefore, with each breath air may get trapped, resulting in
    elevation of the end-expiratory pressure without PEEP being
    set on the ventilator. This may decrease cardiac output because
   it decreases venous return. The other interventions would all
   increase the air trapping.
5. (C) Mouth care decreases bacterial colonization in the mouth,
   which decreases the possibility of microaspiration of bacteria in
   lower airways. The other 3 choices have NOT been found to
   decrease incidences of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
   Sedation should be minimized. The head of the bed should be
   greater than 30°. The ETT cuff should not be deflated prior to
   suctioning but, instead, prior to ETT removal. (At that time, the
   mouth and the subglottic space should be well suctioned.)
6. (A) The goal is to get the FiO2 down to 50% or less ASAP for a
  patient who requires high FiO2. This patient’s oxygenation
  status would allow for a decrease in the FiO2. During acute
   ARDS, the tidal volume needs to be low to prevent volutrauma,
   and the PEEP needs to be maintained to limit atelectasis.
7. (B) Decreased compliance increases “stiffness” and therefore
   requires more work to ventilate. Choice (A) is not correct
   because an increase in the peak inspiratory pressure will
   decrease dynamic compliance. Choice (C) is not correct
   because asthma decreases dynamic (airway) compliance, not
   static (lung) compliance. Choice (D) is not correct because
   dynamic compliance is calculated using the peak inspiratory
   pressure.
8. (B) If the PAOP is high, the pulmonary edema is most likely
   cardiac in origin, whereas in ARDS, the pulmonary edema is
   noncardiogenic in origin. The other 3 choices (bilateral
   infiltrates, refractory hypoxemia, and tachypnea) are all present
   in ARDS.
 9. (C) This clinical scenario is one of right-sided pneumonia.
    Therefore, the right side is the “bad” side. Due to the effects of
    gravity on perfusion, the patient generally does better with the
    “good” lung DOWN. With the “bad” lung down, there is an
    increased risk of worsening hypoxemia. Choice (A) is not
    correct because the patient is not wheezing. Therefore, there is
    no indication for a bronchodilator. Choice (B) is not correct
    because this condition does not warrant NIV. Choice (D) is not
    correct because the best position for a patient with a pulmonary
    problem is sitting upright, not lying flat.
10. (D) A patient with asthma needs a bronchodilator (to treat the
    bronchospasm caused by smooth muscle contraction around
    the airways) and steroids (to treat the airway inflammation).
    There is no indication for anticoagulants, diuretics, or antibiotics
    to treat asthma.
11. (D) An increase in the ventilator breath rate will influence the
    PaCO2 (ventilation), not oxygenation. The other 3 choices will
    improve oxygenation at the tissue level. An increase in the
    FiO2 will provide more oxygen at the alveolar-capillary
    membrane. A blood transfusion will increase oxygen content by
    increasing hemoglobin, which is the carrier of oxygen.
    Increasing a low blood pressure will increase oxygen delivery.
12. (A) The best clinical indicator of effective ventilation is the
    PaCO2. Although a breath rate less than 12 may indicate
    hypoventilation, it is not as sensitive an indicator as is PaCO2.
    In addition, the breath rate does not include the other
    determinant of effective ventilation (depth of ventilation or tidal
    volume). Although a low pH may indicate hypoventilation, it may
   also indicate metabolic acidosis. Hypoxemia (PaO2 less than 80
    mmHg on room air) may be present during hyperventilation.
13. (B) If the patient has a COHb level of 45%, the best SaO2
   achievable is 55% since saturation of hemoglobin cannot be
   greater than 100% total. The patient needs 100% FiO2 until
   COHb levels have returned to normal and symptoms (alteration
   in the level of consciousness and headaches) are relieved.
   Opiates may depress the level of consciousness and mask the
   patient’s response to FiO2. A decrease in the FiO2 would
   decrease the driving forces of oxygen and prolong abnormal
   COHb levels. Intubation would not help oxygenation since the
   same FiO2 can be provided with a face mask. Intubation would
    be indicated for a ventilation problem, but the patient does not
    have signs of hypoventilation.
14. (C) This clinical scenario describes a pneumothorax. As a result
    of hypotension and tracheal deviation to the opposite side of the
    pneumothorax, the pneumothorax is a life-threatening tension
    pneumothorax with symptoms that are the result of a
    mediastinal shift. If ARDS was the problem, the patient would
    have bilateral crackles. If a hemothorax was the problem, there
    would generally be a history of trauma, not an infection. A
    mediastinal shift (tracheal deviation to the opposite side and
    hypotension) is not usually present with a hemothorax. If the
    problem was a PE, the breath sounds would be equal
    bilaterally.
15. (D) The treatment for a tension pneumothorax is a chest tube
    (generally after emergent needle decompression). None of the
    other choices is beneficial for treating a tension pneumothorax.
16. (C) Not enough information is provided to select any condition
    other than acute respiratory failure. Acute respiratory failure is
    an ABG diagnosis, and this ABG meets the requirements of
    acute respiratory failure. Do NOT read into the questions.
17. (A) This patient has severe hypoxemia that needs to be
    addressed first in order to prevent all of the associated effects
    of the severe hypoxemia. Although the patient is not ventilating
    normally, the elevated PaCO2 is less of a problem, as indicated
    by the patient’s mental status. The level of consciousness is not
    depressed. There is no indication in the scenario for choices (C)
    or (D).
18. (D) Initiation of mechanical ventilation (even without PEEP) that
    delivers positive pressure breaths results in a mild increase in
    the intrathoracic pressure with a resultant decrease in venous
    return. PEEP increases the intrathoracic pressure even more
    and causes a decrease in venous return. Mechanical ventilation
    and/or PEEP do not cause any of the other 3 choices.
19. (B) Pneumonia results in a V/Q mismatch, not a shunt.
    Therefore, the administration of oxygen will correct the
    hypoxemia. PEEP is not required as it is for a shunt (ARDS).
    The worse the pneumonia, the greater the FiO2 requirement will
    be. The other 3 choices are possible clinical indicators of
    pneumonia.
20. (C) As ventilation decreases, the PaCO2 rises and affects the
   brain by decreasing the level of consciousness from lethargy to
   an obtunded state, to a stupor, to a comatose state. Although
   the patient MAY have hypoventilation with a respiratory rate of
   20 breaths/minute, it would not be considered a typical sign.
   Anxiety and SpO2 are more likely signs of hypoxemia than early
    signs of hypoventilation.
21. (B) Since the patient has ARDS, low tidal volumes (5–6 mL/kg)
    are indicated (permissive hypercapnia) in order to prevent
    volutrauma. Since the patient weighs 70 kg, a Vt of 700 mL is
    too high. CPAP requires that the patient has a spontaneous
    breathing effort. Therefore, CPAP is not appropriate for this
    patient. A patient with ARDS requires high PEEP to prevent
    atelectasis and hypoxemia. Therefore, a decrease in PEEP
    would worsen the hypoxemia. The plateau pressure should be
    kept at 30 cm H2O or less. Therefore, this patient’s plateau
    pressure is too high, and a decrease in the Vt may help
    decrease the plateau pressure.
22. (D) Sudden bubbling in the negative pressure chamber is an
    indication of a possible air leak; this should be reported to the
    physician. All of the other choices should be avoided when
    caring for a patient with a chest tube. Loops will increase
    pressure in the system. The collection chamber needs to be
    kept below the level of the chest at all times. Clamping the
    chest tube cuts off the negative pressure provided by the
    negative pressure chamber and could result in lung re-collapse.
23. (B) Due to the patient’s decreased level of consciousness, the
    need for improved ventilation is a priority. NIV would address
    the hypoventilation, but it would not be considered safe for a
    patient with minimal responsiveness. Providing oxygen alone
    would not address the main problem (hypoventilation), which in
    this case is worse than the problem of hypoxemia. This patient
    has respiratory acidosis and should not be treated with sodium
    bicarbonate.
24. (A) A depressed level of consciousness may be an indication of
    hypoventilation (respiratory acidosis) and a precursor to
    respiratory arrest for a patient with asthma exacerbation.
    Respiratory alkalosis and bilateral wheezing are common early
    manifestations during an asthma exacerbation. Mild hypoxemia
    should be treated with an increase in FiO2 but is not considered
   ominous unless it is severe.
25. (D) Banked blood does not have normal 2,3-DPG. Low levels of
    2,3-DPG shift the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve up to the
    left, which will decrease hemoglobin’s release of oxygen at the
    tissue level. The remaining 3 choices—a fever, increased levels
    of 2,3-DPG, and acidosis—all shift the curve to the right, which
    increases the release of oxygen from hemoglobin.
26. (B) This clinical scenario is one of a pulmonary embolism. With
    the history of long bone fractures and the development of
    petechiae, a fat embolism is most likely. ARDS does not present
    with clear lungs. DVT does not always result in a PE. If it did,
    though, the PE would be due to a blood clot and petechiae
    would not be present. Delirium may result in agitation but not
    the other symptoms.
27. (B) The low pH indicates acidosis. The low bicarbonate
    indicates that the acidosis is metabolic, and the low PaCO2
   indicates that hyperventilation has started in order to
   compensate. The only option that causes metabolic acidosis is
   shock. Anxiety generally causes respiratory alkalosis. An opiate
drug overdose results in respiratory acidosis. An electrolyte
imbalance (low chloride) causes metabolic alkalosis.
